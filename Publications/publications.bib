We aim to investigate the added prognostic relevance of IHC biomarkers to the ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO risk classification and lymph node (LN) status in EC. Methods Retrospective multicenter study within the European Network for Individualized Treatment of Endometrial Cancer (ENITEC), analyzing pre-operative IHC expression of p53, L1 cell-adhesion molecule (L1CAM), estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), and relate to ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO risk groups, LN status and outcome. Results A total of 763 EC patients were included with a median follow-up of 5.5-years. Abnormal IHC expression was present for p53 in 112 (14.7%), L1CAM in 79 (10.4%), ER- in 76 (10.0%), and PR- in 138 (18.1%) patients. Abnormal expression of p53/L1CAM/ER/PR was significantly related with higher risk classification groups, and combined associated with the worst outcome within the ‘high and advanced/metastatic’ risk group. In multivariate analysis p53-abn, ER/PR- and ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO ‘high and advanced/metastatic’ were independently associated with reduced disease-specific survival (DSS). Patients with abnormal IHC expression and lymph node metastasis (LNM) had the worst outcome. Patients with LNM and normal IHC expression had comparable outcome with patients without LNM and abnormal IHC expression. Conclusion The use of pre-operative IHC biomarkers has important prognostic relevance in addition to the ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO risk classification and in addition to LN status. For daily clinical practice, p53/L1CAM/ER/PR expression could serve as indicator for surgical staging and refine selective adjuvant treatment by incorporation into the ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO risk classification.}

	abstract = {Preoperative MR imaging in endometrial cancer patients provides valuable information on local tumor extent, which routinely guides choice of surgical procedure and adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, whole-volume tumor analyses of MR images may provide radiomic tumor signatures potentially relevant for better individualization and optimization of treatment. We apply a convolutional neural network for automatic tumor segmentation in endometrial cancer patients, enabling automated extraction of tumor texture parameters and tumor volume. The network was trained, validated and tested on a cohort of 139 endometrial cancer patients based on preoperative pelvic imaging. The algorithm was able to retrieve tumor volumes comparable to human expert level (likelihood-ratio test, \$\$p = 0.06\$\$). The network was also able to provide a set of segmentation masks with human agreement not different from inter-rater agreement of human experts (Wilcoxon signed rank test, \$\$p=0.08\$\$, \$\$p=0.60\$\$, and \$\$p=0.05\$\$). An automatic tool for tumor segmentation in endometrial cancer patients enables automated extraction of tumor volume and whole-volume tumor texture features. This approach represents a promising method for automatic radiomic tumor profiling with potential relevance for better prognostication and individualization of therapeutic strategy in endometrial cancer.},

However, when confronted with datasets consisting of multiple values per voxel, traditional reading of the imaging series fails to capture complicated patterns. These patterns of potentially important imaging properties of the parameter space may be critical for the analysis, but standard approaches do not deliver sufficient details. Therefore, in this paper, we present an approach that aims to enable the exploration and analysis of such multiparametric studies using an interactive visual analysis application to remedy the trade-offs between details in the value domain and in spatial resolution. This may aid in the discrimination between healthy and cancerous tissue and potentially highlight metastases that evolved from the primary tumor. We conducted an evaluation with eleven domain experts from different fields of research to confirm the utility of our approach.}

	abstract     = {User studies are often required in biomedical visualization application papers in order to provide evidence for the utility of the presented approach. An important aspect is how well depth information can be perceived, as depth encoding is important to enable an understandable representation of complex data. Unfortunately, in practice there is often little time available to perform such studies, and setting up and conducting user studies may be labor-intensive. In addition, it can be challenging to reach enough participants to support the contribution claims of the paper. In this paper, we propose a system that allows biomedical visualization researchers to quickly generate perceptual task-based user studies for novel surface visualizations, and to perform the resulting experiment via a web interface. This approach helps to reduce effort in the setup of user studies themselves, and at the same time leverages a web-based approach that can help researchers attract more participants to their study. We demonstrate our system using the specific application of depth judgment tasks to evaluate vascular surface visualizations, since there is a lot of recent interest in this area. However, the system is also generally applicable for conducting other task-based user studies in biomedical visualization.}

	abstract     = {Hippocampal enlargements are commonly reported after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). To clarify mechanisms, we examined if ECT-induced hippocampal volume change relates to dose (number of ECT sessions and electrode placement) and acts as a biomarker of clinical outcome. Longitudinal neuroimaging and clinical data from 10 independent sites participating in the Global ECT-Magnetic Resonance Imaging Research Collaboration (GEMRIC) were obtained for mega-analysis. Hippocampal volumes were extracted from structural magnetic resonance images, acquired before and after patients (n = 281) experiencing a major depressive episode completed an ECT treatment series using right unilateral and bilateral stimulation. Untreated nondepressed control subjects (n = 95) were scanned twice. The number of ECT sessions and electrode placement impacts the extent and laterality of hippocampal enlargement, but volume change is not positively associated with clinical outcome. The results suggest that the high efficacy of ECT is not explained by hippocampal enlargement, which alone might not serve as a viable biomarker for treatment outcome.}
